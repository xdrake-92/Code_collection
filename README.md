# Code_collection
These are some of the codes that I will be writing in moving forward with my research work

2m_ring_code counts the number of 2 membered rings/defects on a surface model. Simple rung the python code on the directory itself

top_bottom.py detects the surface densities of OHs on top and bottom surfaces.

convert_data.sh is a file that splits a trajectory file with two or more trajectories and it can print out first half or the second half of the file
all what needs to be done is ,,,
chmod +x convert_data.sh ---> ./convert_data.sh
